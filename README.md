## Bug Bounty Hunting
Every now and then one should review its
tools.
### Tools
#### Bash
GNU/Linux is the biggest and most important tool. Almost 
everything runs GNU/Linux or runs on GNU/Linux. Shell is a 
program or programming language through which you can 
interact with a GNU/Linux system. Although there are many
shells, one of them is the bash shell.

Learn bash. 

Bash is most powerfull when combined with many other 
programs. Two of the particularly usefull ones are 
sed and awk. 

#### Python
Learn python.

#### Nmap
Learn nmap. The best place to start is the 
official book 'Nmap Network Scanning', by the 
author of nmap, Fyodor Lyon.

#### Mitmproxy
Learn mitmproxy.

# Learn
Learning is also a tool and it can be greatly facilitated
by the goals. The more important the goals are, the 
easiest is to learn. You should always learn 
things in the context of your goals. Even if you have 
no goals, try to discover them and 
learn with the faith that one day you may
use your skills to do something important to you.

# Practice

# Be Carefull
Every year, month or day you may get lost. In fact, 
you are always lost. Trying to find your way is 
important. You may go with the faith that some day 
you may find some more clarity. But you will never 
get there completely.

# Read the Documentation
Experts read the documentation. It allows them to see
the whole of some particular technology, which 
enables them to choose appropriate tool for the task.
Choosing an appropriate tool for the task is usually 
trivial, but you can not do it, unless you know what is
available. You get to know that by reading the 
comprehensive documentation.
