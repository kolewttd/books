program or programming language through which you can 
interact with a GNU/Linux system. Although there are many
shells, one of them is the bash shell.

# Learn
Learning is also a tool and it can be greatly facilitated
by the goals. The more important the goals are, the 
easiest is to learn. You should always learn 
things in the context of your goals. Even if you have 
no goals, try to discover them and 
learn with the faith that one day you may
use your skills to do something important to you.

# Practice

# Be Carefull
Every year, month or day you may get lost. In fact, 
you are always lost. Trying to find your way is 
important. You may go with the faith that some day 
you may find some more clarity. But you will never 
get there completely.
